# dogbin - the sexiest pastebin and url shortener ever!
Sharing short code samples, logs, links or markdown notes is now easier than ever!

## Basics
The easiest way to use dogbin, is from inside your browser. Type or paste your content
into the text area on the homepage (`ctrl + n`), save it (`ctrl + s`) and copy the link.
You can now share this link with whoever you want.

If you want to create a short url from a link, simply paste the link in the text field.
You can now copy the resulting link and it will automatically redirect everyone.

### Editing
You can edit your documents by clicking the edit button (or `ctrl + e`).

When you create your first document we will automatically create an (anonymous) account 
for you, so you will be able to edit your documents for as long as you keep our cookie. 
If you want a more permanent way to keep your pastes and edit them from multiple devices
you can [create an account](/register). Pastes which you created before signing up will
be automatically transferred to your account.

### Custom URL
If you want to use a custom slug (the part after `del.dog/`) you can do so by entering
your desired url in the `Custom URL` field.

### Document lifetime
There is no explicit expiration time for documents on dogbin. Documents may however be
removed at any time without notice.

## Using from the command line
You can easily use dogbin from the command line with our official command line client [inu](/inu).

## API usage
The basic dogbin api is an extension of the hastebin API. Extensions include the ability to 
specify a custom slug, and the `X-Api-Key` header.

A more complete documentation and a full rest API (allowing for custom frontends) will be
available soon.

## Donations
I'm running dogbin in my free time, and unfortunately servers aren't free. The traffic 
and required storage is continuously increasing (and thus also server cost). You can financially 
support me via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/deletescape), [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/deletescape) or [PayPal](https://paypal.me/deletescape).
