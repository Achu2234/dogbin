# dogbin migration
dogbin is currently being migrated to a completely new backend (& a refined frontend). All documents on this server will be migrated to the new infrastructure. 
This does however take some time (especially considering how low performance the current server is). To prevent any data inconsistencies we will be running dogbin 
in a read-only mode for the next few hours.
After that we will switch everything to the new server and things should start working as usual again (hopefully).

Some more details about major changes in the new version will be announced on the [changelog page](/changelog.md) after the migration.

## Support me
I'm running dogbin in my free time, and unfortunately servers aren't free. The traffic and required storage is continuously increasing, server cost and maintenance 
closely following along. You can financially support me via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/deletescape), [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/deletescape/) or [PayPal](https://paypal.me/deletescape).
I have lots of cool features planned, some of which might require me to introduce a freemium model.
